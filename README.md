The aim of this repository was to get hands-on experience with Git and GitHub in versioning and collaboration. It helped us understand how to initialize repositories, deal with branches, commit, and collaborate through pull requests and reviews. This activity helped us realize the process of contributing to projects on GitHub.

Steps Followed to Complete the Tutorial:

Installed Git on the local machine and created a GitHub account.
Created a local Git repository on the computer.
Selected a classmate to collaborate with and added them as a collaborator on the GitHub repository.
Created a new branch in the repository to work separately from the main branch.
Added a new file (for example, a text or Python file) that displayed our first and last names.
Committed the new file with the message: “Added sample file for tutorial.”
Pushed the new branch to GitHub.
Created a Pull Request (PR) and assigned the collaborator as the reviewer.
Waited for the collaborator to review and approve the PR.
Once approved, merged the new branch into the main (master) branch.
